 Hypothesis testing: are boys inherently better at math, and do sports positively impact students' academic success?

INTRODUCTION & AIM OF THE PROJECT
The debate over whether boys are naturally better at math and science has persisted for years.
Some experts suggest brain and hormonal differences may give boys an early math advantage.
The outdated belief that boys excel in math and girls in verbal skills shapes societal expectations
in schools. Acceptance of this myth can contribute to gender inequalities in education and
professional fields, limiting equal opportunities for girls in mathematics and sciences.
In addition to testing the hypothesis mentioned in the text, our project aims to investigate another
hypothesis: that physical activity positively influences academic performance. We will explore the
potential correlation between students' physical activity engagement and academic
achievements, focusing on math and science.
The main point of our research is to explore preconceptions about gender-based abilities in math.
Eliminating the notion that boys are inherently better at math can create an environment where
every child, regardless of gender, has an equal chance to succeed. We also plan to explore the
impact of physical activity. So the project's second aim is to prove or refute that regular
sports activities positively impact students' academic performance.
DATA
We will use data from the Student's Exam Scores dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores), which includes scores from
three test scores of students at a public school and a variety of personal and socioeconomic
factors that may have interaction effects upon them.
The dataset contains more than 30 thousand rows of data and the 14 columns shown above, but
we will use only 5: Gender, PracticeSport, MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore.
HYPOTHESIS to explore:
Boys are naturally better at math than girls.
Sports positively impact studentsâ€™ academic success
